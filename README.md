Digital solutions to help increase access, manage health, and improve patient satisfaction along the healthcare journey.
Our group decided to tackle the disproportionate access to cancer screenings across various factors such as, location, ethnicity, and family history. Our app ProactivePath implements our predictive algorithm that categorizes patients as low or high risk for certain cancers based on these factors. The app then creates appropriate reminders to ensure patients are completeling certain cancer screenings regularly. Additionally, our app contains easy to navigate appointment scheduling with appropriate filters, such that patients can pick providers according to their specifc needs. 
The app can be viewed using the following link:
